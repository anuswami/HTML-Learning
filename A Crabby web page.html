		<h1>Crabcake Recipe</h1>
		</br>
		</br>
		<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
		<p style="color=yellow;font-size:medium;"></p>
		<ul>
			<li>1 lb. jumbo lump or backfin crab meat</li>
			<li>2 slices bread or bread crumbs</li>
			<li>1 tbsp. mayonnaise (light or regular)</li>
			<li>1 tbsp. Dijon mustard</li>
			<li>2 tsp. Old Bay seasoning</li>
			<li>1 tbsp. snipped parsley</li> 
			<li>1 egg (or substitute for special diets)</li>
			<li>tartar sauce or cocktail sauce</li>
		</ul>
			<h2>Directions:</h2>
			<p>
				Beat the egg in a bowl. Trim the crusts from the bread and
			<br/>
				break the slices into small pieces. Add these pieces to the egg.
			<br/>				
				Mix in the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, Chesapeake seasoning and 
			<br/>
				parsley, and beat well.</p>
				
			<p>
				Place the crabmeat in a bowl and pour the egg mixture over the top.
			<br/>				
				Gently toss or fold the ingredients together, 
			<br/>
				taking care not to break up the lumps of crabmeat.</p>
				
			<p>
			Form the cakes by hand into patties about 3 inches around and 3/4-inch thick.<br/> 
			Shape should be like a cookie, not like a meatball or golf ball.<br/> 
			Place the cakes in the refrigerator for at least 45 minutes before cooking.<br/> 
			This is very important so the cakes don't fall apart.<br/></p>
			
		<h2>Broil the Crab Cakes:</h2>
			<p>Slip them under a preheated broiler until nicely browned,<br/> 
			turning to cook evenly, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side.</p>
		<h2>Or saute:</h2>
			<p>Heat a small amount of butter or olive oil in a skillet and saute the cakes,<br/>
			turning several times, until golden brown or about 8 minutes total cooking time.<br/><br/>
			Serve at once with tartar sauce, mustard, or cocktail sauce on the side.</p>
